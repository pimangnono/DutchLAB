#### 2.  Deploy Token and Create an Auction
Deploy the token contract and initialize an auction. This setup will allow other accounts to participate in bidding.

#### 3. Start the Auction
Start the auction to begin the countdown for the bidding period. Once started, users can begin placing bids within the specified timeframe

#### 4. Change Account and Place a Bid
Switch to a different account in Metamask, navigate to the auction interface, and place your bid. Ensure that your bid amount complies with the auctionâ€™s parameters.

#### 5. Reveal the Bid After the Bidding Period Ends
After the bidding period ends, each bidder should reveal their bid by interacting with the auction contract. Follow the prompts on the frontend to complete the reveal.

#### 6. Distribute Tokens to Bidders Once the Reveal Period Ends
Once the reveal period ends, the contract will allow token distribution to successful bidders based on their bid amounts and the auction rules.
